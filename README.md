# Project Information

## Overview

This project is a responsive portfolio website with a distinctive layout. The website is divided into two main sections: the profile side and the gallery side. It utilizes HTML and CSS for the structure and styling, creating an engaging and visually appealing user interface.

## Styles

### Reset CSS

The reset CSS ensures consistent styling across different browsers by resetting margins, paddings, and setting the box-sizing property to border-box.

### HTML and Body Styling

The HTML and body elements are styled to occupy the entire viewport, with a font size of 1.4rem for optimized legibility. Default link styles are removed, and a dark background color (#022) is applied to the body.

## Portfolio Container

The portfolio container is a full-width flex container that vertically and horizontally centers its content. It has a minimum height of 100vh, ensuring it spans the full height of the screen.

## Profile Side

The profile side takes up 50% of the total width and 50% of the minimum height of the portfolio container. It features a flex display for centered content, including a profile logo with a hover effect, user name and description styling, and a stylized button.

## Gallery Side

The gallery side occupies the remaining 50% of the width and 70% of the minimum height. It utilizes a grid display with six columns and seven rows to showcase a visually appealing gallery of images. Each image box is carefully styled with a background color, border-radius, and a captivating hover effect.

### Responsive Design

For screens smaller than 600px, the layout adjusts to a single column, providing optimal viewing on mobile devices.

### Image Box Styling

The image boxes have a background color, border-radius, and a transition effect for a smooth hover experience. The hover effect includes a blend mode change and background position adjustment.

## Conclusion

This responsive portfolio website combines clean HTML and CSS to achieve a visually appealing and user-friendly design. The distinctive layout and careful styling of profile and gallery sections make it an attractive showcase for personal or professional use.
